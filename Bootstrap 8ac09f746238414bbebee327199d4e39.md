# Bootstrap

# **Breakpoints**

Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.

## **Core concepts**

- **Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.** Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.
- **Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint.** Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. We most commonly use `min-width` in our media queries.
- **Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.** Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.

## **Available breakpoints**

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as *grid tiers*, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.

| Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extra small | None | <576px |
| Small | sm | ≥576px |
| Medium | md | ≥768px |
| Large | lg | ≥992px |
| Extra large | xl | ≥1200px |
| Extra extra large | xxl | ≥1400px |

Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 12. Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions—they don’t specifically target every use case or device. Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.

These breakpoints are customizable via Sass—you’ll find them in a Sass map in our `_variables.scss` stylesheet.

# **Containers**

Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.

## **How they work**

Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are **required when using our default grid system**. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers *can* be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

- `.container`, which sets a `max-width` at each responsive breakpoint
- `.container-{breakpoint}`, which is `width: 100%` until the specified breakpoint
- `.container-fluid`, which is `width: 100%` at all breakpoints

The table below illustrates how each container’s `max-width` compares to the original `.container` and `.container-fluid` across each breakpoint.

See them in action and compare them in our [Grid example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/grid/#containers).

|  | Extra small<576px | Small≥576px | Medium≥768px | Large≥992px | X-Large≥1200px | XX-Large≥1400px |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .container | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px | 1320px |
| .container-sm | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px | 1320px |
| .container-md | 100% | 100% | 720px | 960px | 1140px | 1320px |
| .container-lg | 100% | 100% | 100% | 960px | 1140px | 1320px |
| .container-xl | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1140px | 1320px |
| .container-xxl | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1320px |
| .container-fluid | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |

## **Default container**

Our default `.container` class is a responsive, fixed-width container, meaning its `max-width` changes at each breakpoint.

```html
<div class="container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```

## **Responsive containers**

Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply `max-width`s for each of the higher breakpoints. For example, `.container-sm` is 100% wide to start until the `sm` breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl`.

```html
<div class="container-sm">100% wide until small breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-md">100% wide until medium breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-lg">100% wide until large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xl">100% wide until extra large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xxl">100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint</div>
```

## **Fluid containers**

Use `.container-fluid` for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

```html
<div class="container-fluid">
  ...
</div>
```

# **Grid system**

Use our powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, six default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.

## **Example**

Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It’s built with [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth explanation for how the grid system comes together.

![Screenshot (168).png](Bootstrap%208ac09f746238414bbebee327199d4e39/Screenshot_(168).png)

```html
The above example creates three equal-width columns across all devices and viewports using our predefined grid classes. Those columns are centered in the page with the parent .container.
```

## **How it works**

Breaking it down, here’s how the grid system comes together:

- **Our grid supports [six responsive breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/).** Breakpoints are based on `min-width` media queries, meaning they affect that breakpoint and all those above it (e.g., `.col-sm-4` applies to `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl`). This means you can control container and column sizing and behavior by each breakpoint.
- **Containers center and horizontally pad your content.** Use `.container` for a responsive pixel width, `.container-fluid` for `width: 100%` across all viewports and devices, or a responsive container (e.g., `.container-md`) for a combination of fluid and pixel widths.
- **Rows are wrappers for columns.** Each column has horizontal `padding` (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This `padding` is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins to ensure the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side. Rows also support modifier classes to [uniformly apply column sizing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#row-columns) and [gutter classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/gutters/) to change the spacing of your content.
- **Columns are incredibly flexible.** There are 12 template columns available per row, allowing you to create different combinations of elements that span any number of columns. Column classes indicate the number of template columns to span (e.g., `col-4` spans four). `width`s are set in percentages so you always have the same relative sizing.
- **Gutters are also responsive and customizable.** [Gutter classes are available](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/gutters/) across all breakpoints, with all the same sizes as our [margin and padding spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/). Change horizontal gutters with `.gx-*` classes, vertical gutters with `.gy-*`, or all gutters with `.g-*` classes. `.g-0` is also available to remove gutters.
- **Sass variables, maps, and mixins power the grid.** If you don’t want to use the predefined grid classes in Bootstrap, you can use our [grid’s source Sass](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#sass-variables) to create your own with more semantic markup. We also include some CSS custom properties to consume these Sass variables for even greater flexibility for you.

Be aware of the limitations and [bugs around flexbox](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs), like the [inability to use some HTML elements as flex containers](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs#flexbug-9).

## **Grid options**

Bootstrap’s grid system can adapt across all six default breakpoints, and any breakpoints you customize. The six default grid tiers are as follows:

- Extra small (xs)
- Small (sm)
- Medium (md)
- Large (lg)
- Extra large (xl)
- Extra extra large (xxl)

As noted above, each of these breakpoints have their own container, unique class prefix, and modifiers. Here’s how the grid changes across these breakpoints:

|  | xs<576px | sm≥576px | md≥768px | lg≥992px | xl≥1200px | xxl≥1400px |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Container max-width | None (auto) | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px | 1320px |
| Class prefix | .col- | .col-sm- | .col-md- | .col-lg- | .col-xl- | .col-xxl- |
| # of columns | 12 |  |  |  |  |  |
| Gutter width | 1.5rem (.75rem on left and right) |  |  |  |  |  |
| Custom gutters | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/gutters/ |  |  |  |  |  |
| Nestable | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#nesting |  |  |  |  |  |
| Column ordering | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/#reordering |  |  |  |  |  |

# **Columns**

Learn how to modify columns with a handful of options for alignment, ordering, and offsetting thanks to our flexbox grid system. Plus, see how to use column classes to manage widths of non-grid elements.

## **How they work**

- **Columns build on the grid’s flexbox architecture.** Flexbox means we have options for changing individual columns and [modifying groups of columns at the row level](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#row-columns). You choose how columns grow, shrink, or otherwise change.
- **When building grid layouts, all content goes in columns.** The hierarchy of Bootstrap’s grid goes from [container](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/) to row to column to your content. On rare occasions, you may combine content and column, but be aware there can be unintended consequences.
- **Bootstrap includes predefined classes for creating fast, responsive layouts.** With [six breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/) and a dozen columns at each grid tier, we have dozens of classes already built for you to create your desired layouts. This can be disabled via Sass if you wish.

## **Alignment**

Use flexbox alignment utilities to vertically and horizontally align columns.

### **Horizontal alignment**

Change the horizontal alignment with any of the responsive `justify-content-*` classes.

![Screenshot (173).png](Bootstrap%208ac09f746238414bbebee327199d4e39/Screenshot_(173).png)

```html
<div class="container text-center">
<div class="row justify-content-start">
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-end">
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-around">
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-between">
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-evenly">
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
<div class="col-4">
One of two columns
</div>
</div>
</div>
```

### **Column wrapping**

If more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, each group of extra columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line.
